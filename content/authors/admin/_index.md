Howdy! I'm a trail runner, researcher, and outdoor enthusiast currently based in Logan, Utah. I study how the effects of climate change manifest in mountain ecosystems, and I'm espeically interested in how the outdoor community can help monitor and address the changes wrought by rising temperatures. 

At present, I'm working as a Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Janice Brahney in the [Environmental Biogeochemistry and Paleolimnology Lab](https://janicebrahney.weebly.com) at Utah State University. My master's thesis research explores how rising soil temperatures affect nutrient cycling in mountain watersheds. When I'm not out collecting soil samples or doing lab work, I'm also a professional trail/ultrarunner for adidas TERREX. I'm fascinated by the parellels between running and environmental research, so on this site you'll find a smattering of both and, hopefully, some areas of commonality and potential collaboration. Thanks for visiting!
